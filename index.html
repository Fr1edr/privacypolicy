        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Sticky Message! I am Farchy, the developer of this Discord bot. This privacy policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your information when you use Sticky Message.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>Sticky Message does not collect or store personal data from users. The bot processes and stores messages for functionality purposes, such as sticky messages, but this data is not shared with third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The messages are stored temporarily to provide the bot’s functionality, such as pinning messages to specific channels. This data is used solely for enhancing bot performance. Sticky Message does not use any personal information for marketing or other purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>I do not share any collected data with third parties. I take reasonable measures to protect the data processed by Sticky Message from unauthorized access and use.</p>
        
        <h2>User Rights</h2>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this privacy policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted on the bot’s description or documentation.</p>
